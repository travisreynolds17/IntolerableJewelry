    t "So. Questions?"

    d "Oh. Okay."

    d "So... you run St. Agatha's Revelation?"

    t 1a "I do."

    t "It's a recovery program for those who find themselves searching for a path past addiction."

    d "Why Saint Agatha?"

    t "Ah, that's right. You're a beautiful heathen, aren't you."

    d "You're sure you aren't Elsa?"

    t "Agatha is the patron saint of nurses, among other things. I wanted my mission to be one of rebirth."

    t "Recovering from addiction means finding a fresh start, an entire new way of being, under the guiding hand of nurturing caregivers."

    d "Are you a nurse?"

    t 1a "I am. And a midwife, it turns out."

    d "So you're really into the birth metaphor."

    t "I suppose it fits."

    d "I'm looking at this list, and... huh. So the piano chick was in your program, too?"

    t "Cassandra, yes."

    d "And Sophie and Louisa, too."

    t "Yes."

    d "Not Lichelle?"

    t 1m "Oh, no. I hired her because we've been friends forever and I needed some security I could trust."

    t "You may have noticed the program caters entirely to women."

    d "I did."

    t "Women can open up and be themselves far more easily without a male presence."

    t 1a "It's true in reverse, of course."

    d "Yeah, that's true. I like Lichelle, by the way. She's funny, reminds me of my big sister."

    d "So, uh, I'm gonna skip a few of these questions here, and..."

    t "..."

    d "The night Louisa died."

    t 1b "... yes."

    d "When did you find out?"

    t "Lichelle called me as soon as she could."

    t 1o "Did you know she carried Cassandra back into Ganymead that night?"

    d "Can't say I did."

    t "Cassandra's the one who pulled Louisa out of the water. She was wearing practically nothing, just a basic little black dress."

    t "She shut down. I remember seeing it on the security recordings. She pulled Louisa out, she tried to revive her, and then she just..."

    t 1b "... she just sat there, freezing."

    d "I always thought she had an interest in Louisa. Everybody did, but piano girl always looked like a high school kid scared to talk to her crush."

    t "Something like that. Lichelle realized Louisa was gone, and she scooped up Cassandra like she was made of paper."

    t 1a "I was proud of her."

    d "What about Sophie? She never told me exactly what happened. We weren't on the best terms at that point."

    t "Oh? Why is that?"

    d "... am I dreaming?"

    t "Someone must be, don't you think?"

    d "Elsa. You ARE Elsa, right?"

    t 1a "Sophie was angry with you because you and Elsa comforted one another after Sophie rejected you."

    t "Isn't that right?"

    d "... yeah."

    t "Sophie was moving in such a good direction with you."

    t 1m "She started her gaming channel, she was drawing again. She earned that level one sobriety card, David."

    d "Yeah."

    t 1a "Then Louisa showed up."

    d "Yeah."

    t "Even I was taken in by her. She was exotic and interesting and dangerous."

    t 2o "She never lost her cool about anything. I would never, ever have believed her to be a heroin addict if she hadn't showed me her scars."

    d "Track marks?"

    t 2b "Among other things. I don't think she ever let anyone know what her life was like in Europe, but it must have been awful."

    t "Lichelle was fond of her, too. Until she met Sophie."

    t 2a "When Louisa met Sophie, it was like black curtains drew closed over the rest of the world."

    t "She only had eyes for Sophie, for reasons I don't fully understand."

    d "I can understand."

    t 1a "Of all people, perhaps only you could."

    d "... so, that night."

    t "I'm sorry. I sidetracked myself a bit."

    t "I went to Ganymead as soon as I could."

    d "It's good to have friends in power, isn't it?"

    t "It's to earn friends in power. St. Agatha's hadn't had a single overdose in our program in years, and now we've had two back to back."

    d "Two?"

    t "When you and Elsa were, I mean."

    t 2r "Louisa was dosed out of her mind that night."

    t "You can see on the cameras. She's sitting on the edge of the fountain and she has a seizure."

    t 1a "Everybody in my program gets medical evaluations and checkups. We aren't cheap. You know that."

    d "... yeah."

    t "Louisa had no history of seizures. She has several healed injuries, David: stab wounds. Broken bones. Scars upon scars."

    t 1o "But no seizures. No reason for her to pass out like that."

    d "What did you do?"

    t "... I made a mistake."

    t 1b "I turned a blind eye to Sophie's problems. There were so many others to care for and some part of me blamed her for Louisa's death."

    t "I don't mean to complain. My situation is easy compared to theirs, but I'm still human."

    t 1c "So while Cassandra put in with Sophie, for her own reasons, that's when you and I..."

    d "Yeah."

    d "I'm not mad about it."

    t 2o "You're not?"

    d "Nope."

    d "You needed comfort. So did I. We're not sulking teenagers, Elsa."

    d "Sometimes sex is just medicine. It's easier for men to think that way, I think."

    t 1b "... it is."

    d "Are you angry with me?"

    t "... yes. No."

    t "I think I'm more upset with myself than anything."
