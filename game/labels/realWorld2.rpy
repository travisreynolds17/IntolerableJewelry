    # later, this art needs to be of a snowy fountain outside a town square. I think Sophie might be drunk and freezing to death in this story. Maybe.

    "Somehow I find myself back outside the bar."

    "Sketch pad in hand, I'm waiting on the benches for something interesting to come by."

    "Something meaningful. Anything."

    "From within the building, I can hear a woman singing. It's impossible to make out the words."

    "Her voice rings crystal clear, but the words are muddled."

    "Is that snow?"

    "Near the door, a bouncer puffs on a casual cigarette."

    "Scratch that. From the scent, a {i}very{/i} casual cigarette."

    "I find myself scratching her onto paper, in that crisp suit and vest combo common to bouncers, bartenders and stylish lesbians."

    "At least, common to their depictions."

    pause 1.0

    "She wears her hair in neat, tight cornrows. I wonder if she would wear it differently were her job less prone to getting in fights."

    "The long-legged woman sets her cushion on the fountain rim."

    "The ice in my drink clinks musically."

    "Her hair spills over her shoulders like papal mercy."

    "Is that snow?"

    "She's undone her buttons."

    "Tonight, a third. Such magical times. Snowflakes sizzle and die against her chest, leaving little glittering paths that snake between her breasts."

    "I remember my Vonnegut."

    "So it goes."

    pause 0.5

    "Someone's drowning her."

    pause 0.5

    "When did that start?"

    "Her long legs stream up from the fountain, kicking wildly, a climactic eruption of foam and spray billowing from the fountain."

    "There's something inhuman about a drowning. Can't see the victim's face. Only limbs akimbo."

    "Was I sipping my drink before or after?"

    "Could be anyone's arms and legs, really."

    "The bouncer moves like murder."

    "Her beautiful brown arms wrench around the attacker's neck, squeezing, a sultry, pythonic embrace."

    "I smell iron."

    "Someone wearing a glittery onyx dress appears from within the bar."

    "I can see her screaming, but... but I can't hear her."

    "Dragging she of the long legs from the fountain."

    "The negroni tastes mature."

    "She must be freezing in the snow, drenched in fountain water."

    "Beautiful in her pallor."

    "Onyx Dress pushes against her chest."

    "Breaking ribs. Two, more?"

    "The python relaxes. No one important lies jolting in the snow."

    "Long legs's mouth erupts in steam and retch."

    "What are those lights?"

    "My sketch pad is ruined."

    "It got wet in the snow."

    "I should've done something."

    "Why does my head hurt?"

    "She finally looked at me."
