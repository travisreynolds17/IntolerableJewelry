    "She was the host."

    "For a while."

    "I met her there, sitting outside by the fountain, scribbling away on my sketch pad."

    "Hey. That's mine."

    "Where did you find that, I asked her, courageous."

    "She showed me her drawing, and I was amazed at how precise a single point could be."

    "A single point, molecular sharp, somehow evoking an intense, pillowy calmness."

    "How could you draw like that, miss? And... where did you find my sketch pad?"

    "Snow wafts obliviously to the earth."

    "I'll show you, she would have said, if I could have heard it."

    "It's cold, I wondered. Inside? Inside the bar?"

    "We are already there, babe, and I love you."

    "Mmm. Thank you for saying so."

    "You know Elsa, too?"

    "You've been watching me."

    "Yes."

    "I was waiting for you to say something."

    "This is how our conversation went."

            "Shh. I don't think the swelling will go down again."
            "Oh. The pencil was bad, wasn't it."

        "Suicide symptomatic of Birth":
            "Nothing is anything or anything else."
            "Whose blood is that? The tile feels cool."

    "You're yellow."

    "Was I always?"

    "I love you."

    "The pencil was no good."

    "It wasn't, was it."

    "Tainted. The tainted pencil drew corrupt pictures."

    "Oh, no."

    "You aren't breathing."

    "I'm not, am I. Oh, well."

    "I love your lap."

    "Please breathe."

    "I should?"

    "It's a good idea, isn't it?"

    "No. Why did you corrupt the pencil?"

    "You knew about that, Sophie?"

    "Mm."

    "Her name was Louisa."

    "Was? Her?"

    "The tile is cold, isn't it?"

    "Mm. But your lap is warm."

    "She's cold now. Because of you. But I love you."

    "I love you, too."

    "I'm taking your clothes away. Do you mind?"

    "So tired."

    "Sleep. Never wake up."

    "Mmkay."

    "Promise?"

    "Mm."

    "You're the most yellow you've ever been."

    "Thank you for saying that. I feel cold. Sweating."

    "You should."

    "Kiss me."

    "I'd love to, babe."

    "What did you give me? You're kissing me now, but I can't feel your lips."

    "Give you?"

    "I can't feel your fingers. What did you put in me?"

    "Peace."
