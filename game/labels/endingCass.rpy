    "Mortimer spins in the air, for no reason I can deduce, and leads the way from Tania's..."

    "Bedroom? I guess?"

    "The house blooms outward from a grand staircase in the foyer. I can hear David shouting about Pittsburgh's football team being evil, down to the man, from the parlor nearby."

    pause 0.5

    "I'm curious about what's upstairs, but the little robot floats past the staircase and through a set of padded double doors that remind me of old gothic horror movies."

    "A few timid, wandering notes sing softly from within."

    "The music room is intimate, warm and comfortable, everything one might expect from a place like this."

    "Even the floor is laid out in a black and white checkerboard pattern, like piano keys."

    "Speaking of which, there's a gorgeous baby grand sitting proudly across the room."

    "And suddenly, Cassandra."

    "She looks exactly like her counterpart in the simulation, somehow."

    "Choker and all."

    s "Cassandra."

    "It's odd. Her name came to my lips, but anything beyond that?"

    "I have no idea what to say. Nice to see you? How've you been? Glad you're alive?"

    "She doesn't answer. She doesn't have to."

    "Cassandra settles onto the piano bench, brushes a bit of her hair from her eyes."

    "And plays."

    #piano song. whatever.

    "She plays so beautifully."

    "And patiently."

    "She's clearly in no hurry, but that's fine."

    "Watching her play is mesmerizing. The way she sways, the way she looks almost bored, resigned to her hands going through the motions."

    "She seems so unreachable."

    "I find myself applauding, which I suppose is just clapping when a person is alone."

    "She pats the piano bench next to her. Beckons to me with one hand."

    #show cass up close?

    "The bench is warm where she was sitting."

    "I don't know when, or if, to speak."

    "She begins to play again, a jaunty, upbeat tune with just a hint of wistfulness."

    "I don't recognize the tune, but a tilt of her chin leads me to follow her gaze to the sheet music."

    "'To you, my friend'."

    "I should say something. But for now, I only listen."

    "I guess I should have listened sooner."

        "And... hibiscus. Definitely."

        "I wonder what to do."

        "No, I don't. I know."

        "She doesn't flinch when I slip my arm around her waist."

        "A smile. Just a small, small smile."

        "A tear on her cheek."

        "She said she wasn't interested in women."
        
        "But I wonder."

        "I won't push her. I won't try to change her."

        "I want to let her make up her own mind."

        "But for just now, just this moment"

        "I want to dream."
