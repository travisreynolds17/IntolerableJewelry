    "On the other side of the grand staircase, away from the parlor where David has begun philosophizing on the utility of timing belts, the little robot stops."

    "I'm not sure what I expected when Tania said the word gym, but this isn't exactly it."

    "Most of the equipment appears therapeutic in nature: yoga mats and blocks, foam cylinders, a massage table."

    "There do appear to be a few new additions, though. Boxing equipment seems somewhat hastily rigged up, with shipping boxes stacked against the wall nearby."

    "There's one other new addition."

    l "Don't be discouraged babe. Just tap out! I've done it thousands of times."

    "She's lying perpendicular to me, her legs draped across my chest and my arm wrenched tightly in her grip."

    "Sighing quietly, I slap the mat beneath us. Just like that the pressure's gone and she's rolling backward, on her feet before I've even sat back up."

    l "I believe it."

    "She gives me her hand and helps me to my feet. There's so much strength in her grip."

    s "So you could pretty much break my arm any time you want."

    l "Maybe. Jujitsu's not about that though. It's about humility."

    l 1a "I'm a black belt, but there are tons of people out there who could tie me in knots."

    s "I'd hate to meet them."

    l "Nah. Just about every jujitsu player is cool."

    s "So... how've you been? Since then."

    l 1m "We should roll again. What do you say?"

    s "I don't think it's going to do me much good and I think you might be dodging the question."

    l 1k "What do you want me to say?"

    s "I just think we should talk about what happened."

    l "Don't wanna. There's gonna be time for that now that we're here."
    
    l 1a "And I'd rather just have a good time with a new friend. Roll. Grab dinner. Drink beer. Talk shit."

    s "And?"

    l "Tania cares about everybody in her program. She's gonna try to help you however she can."

    s "You think she's lying to me."

    l 1m "I do. Doesn't matter, babe."

    s "You called me that in the simulation."

    l 1r "What, babe? I call everyone that."

    s "No, I... you said it differently."

    s "You know very well that's impossible for me."

    l "Yup."

    "It's frustrating, but I understand how she feels."

    "Maybe we all remember the simulation differently?"

    "I find myself rubbing the scattered scars on my arm."

    "Maybe it really never happened."

    s "It wasn't that long ago."

    s "Why DID you ask me here?"

    l 1a "Wanted to roll with you."
    s "What on earth could you get out of that? It's like swatting flies for you."
    l 1m "Swatting flies is an awesome feeling."
    s "No it isn't! The poor flies."
    l 1j "Flies are assholes."
    s "They're just trying to survive."

    s "Wha?"
    l 1j "I'm kidding."
    l 1m "I'm trying not to dwell on this stuff, babe."
    s "Is that why you won't tell me how you feel?"
    l 1r "Huh? About what?"
    s "You know what."
    l "I really don't."

    "And so we reset. The whole time, she's allowed me to start out in a dominant position."

    "She lays out on the floor, stretched out, eyes amused."

    "Instead of hopping on top of her — only to have her fling me away and put me in some kind of hold or crank anyway — I lie next to her."

    s "You don't have to talk about how you feel, but I will."

    l "If you want."

    s "I want."

    s "For me, everything I went through felt multiplied. Maybe it's because Kylie and I never really separated or re-fused or whatever was gonna happen."

    s "All the fear, though. All the hurt. Every bit of it felt deeper and heavier than it would have out here."

    l "You're sure about that? Like how do you know."

    s "I know. I know what I feel. I'm still afraid to put on a headset."

    l "..."

    s "You think you could tap her out?"

    l "I don't think she could get licensed to fight. Pretty sure you need to be able to move."

    s "And it's probably hard to armbar a flying robot ball thing."

    l "I'd find a way."

    s "I believe it. I also believe the things I felt about you in there are real."
