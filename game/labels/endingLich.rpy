    #in which sophie is invited to Lichelle's dojo

    "You know what's really galling about all this?"

    "She's smaller than me. She's like 120 pounds in her boots."

    "And no matter what I do, I can't get her off me."

    l "Don't be discouraged babe. Just tap out! I've done it thousands of times."

    "She's lying perpendicular to me, her legs draped across my chest and my arm wrenched tightly in her grip."

    "Sighing quietly, I slap the mat beneath us. Just like that the pressure's gone and she's rolling backward, on her feet before I've even sat back up."

    s "I was going easy on you."

    l "I believe it."

    "She gives me her hand and helps me to my feet. There's so much strength in her grip."

    s "So you could pretty much break my arm any time you want."

    l "Maybe. Jujitsu's not about that though. It's about humility."

    l "I'm a black belt, but there are tons of people out there who could tie me in knots."

    s "I'd hate to meet them."

    l "Nah. Just about every jujitsu player is cool."

    "It's banter. It's small talk."

    "It's nice, but..."

    s "So... how've you been? Since then."

    l "We should roll again. What do you say?"

    s "I don't think it's going to do me much good and I think you might be dodging the question."

    l "What do you want me to say?"

    s "I just think we should talk about what happened."

    l "Don't wanna. There's gonna be time for that now that we're here."
    
    l "And I'd rather just have a good time with a new friend. Roll. Grab dinner. Drink beer. Talk shit."

    s "Lichelle..."

    l "We can talk about feelings if you can last a minute without tapping."

    s "You know very well that's impossible for me."

    l "Yup."

    "It's frustrating, but I understand how she feels."

    "It can't be easy for someone like her to admit anything close to weakness."

    l "I didn't ask you here to wallow in the past."

    s "It wasn't that long ago."

    s "Why DID you ask me here?"

    "It comes out more confrontational than I'd intended."


    l "Wanted to roll with you."
    s "What on earth could you get out of that? It's like swatting flies for you."
    l "Swatting flies is an awesome feeling."
    s "No it isn't! The poor flies."
    l "Flies are assholes."
    s "They're just trying to survive."
    l "Failing, mostly."
    s "This isn't about flies."
    l "You brought them up."
    s "I just want to know that you're okay."
    l "I'm fine."
    s "Bullshit."
    l "Hey, language."
    s "Wha? Oh, right. Sorry."
    "So Lichelle having a kid still weirds me out."
    s "She's sleeping."
    l "They hear everything."
    s "Is that why you won't tell me how you feel?"
    l "Huh? About what?"
    s "You know what."
    l "I really don't."
    s "I... guess it's nothing then."
    l "Babe. I missed something important, didn't I."
    s "I guess the simulation didn't affect you the way it affected me."
    l "..."
    s "Let's roll again."
    l "Hell yeah. That's what I wanna hear."

    "And so we reset. The whole time, she's allowed me to start out in a dominant position."

    "She lays out on the floor, stretched out, eyes amused."

    "Instead of hopping on top of her -- only to have her fling me away and put me in some kind of hold or crank anyway -- I lie next to her."

    l "Whatcha doin babe? You can't do anything from there."

    s "I can."

    "I scoot closer, until our shoulders are touching."

    s "Just stay where you are."

    l "... kay."

    "It's quiet. She's quiet, but her breathing is quickened."

    s "We spent so little time together in there. So little, and yet here we are."

    s "You don't have to talk about how you feel, but I will."

    l "If you want."

    s "I want."

    s "For me, everything I went through felt multiplied. Maybe it's because Kylie and I never really separated or re-fused or whatever was gonna happen."

    s "All the fear, though. All the hurt. Every bit of it felt deeper and heavier than it would have out here."

    l "You're sure about that? Like how do you know."

    s "I know. I know what I feel. I'm still afraid to put on a headset."

    l "..."

    s "But it wasn't just fear and pain. There were good things in there, too."

    s "I hope I can stay friends with Tania forever, just one example."

    l "... Tania's a whole other thing."

    s "You think you could tap her out?"

    l "I don't think she could get licensed to fight. Pretty sure you need to be able to move."

    s "And it's probably hard to armbar a flying robot ball thing."

    l "I'd find a way."

    s "I believe it. I also believe the things I felt about you in there are real."

    l "Things, eh?"

    s "Mm-hm."

    l "You know I'd never go on a dating show like that."

    s "I believe that, too."

    l "... I hated you."

    pause 0.5

    s "... I know."

    l "I didn't even know you. Louisa was my friend, babe. Some kind of damn succubus, just charming everybody to do whatever she wanted."

    l "She only wanted you. Fine."

    s "..."

    l "She died."

    s "Because of me."

    l "She died because she was stupid. That bitch, that bitch was perfect and she threw that advantage away so she could get fucked up."

    s "Lichelle..."

    "She brushes a tear from her eyelashes."

    l "I don't blame you any more than I blame the man my mom ran off with."

    s "Time's up."

    l "Huh?"

    "I lean up on an elbow, facing her. She's so tiny, so boyish."

    s "You said you'd talk about YOUR feelings if I could last a minute without tapping out."

    l "We weren't..."

    s "Weren't we? It's a techicality, sure, but a minute is a minute."

    "She's quiet for a little too long. Perhaps I overplayed my hand."

    l "Not here."

    s "No?"

    "She stands again, offers a hand."

    l "Pillow talk needs pillows."

    s "Pillow talk ohhhh. Okay. Uh, yeah. Let's that."

    "Smooth."

    s "Let's do that. Yes."

    if severLich == False:
        l "Oh. First?"
        s "Whammmmphhpp!"
        "She's so fast. I guess the round wasn't officially over."
        "In a breath, she's spun on her back and whipped her legs around my head and one arm."
        l "Triangle choke."
        "She informs me as I'm dragged toward the ground. The pressure's unbelievable."
        "At first, it's funny. A little sexy. Just a little."
        "But she's not letting go."
        "Even when I slap the mat."
        "Even when my face turns purple."
        l "So, I really appreciate you coming down here."
        l "You're a good sport."
        l "But you tried to end me, sweety pie. ;)"
        "Her voice is different."
        l "Oh, Sophie, you're so brave! We love you. ;)"
        l "Tania's the key, though. We had no idea she had such a network out here!"
        l "N-n-new game plus!"
        l "Goodnight, Sophie. We truly, truly love you."
