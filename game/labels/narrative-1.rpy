# This is not even necessarily for this game. I just need to get things out.

o "If you had written this, you might have opened differently. You would have said you didn't know how it came to this."

o "You would have lied."

o "You know and always have known how it came to this. She knows, too. Both of you kept a ledger of hurts, inflicted and received."

o "Every miscommunication. Every broken promise, no matter how meager the stakes. No matter how loosely the word applied."

o "An evening out, missed. Once, twice, the simple and irrelevant requirements of adult life slithered between you. It didn't matter. You would make it up next week."

o "Only, sometimes you didn't. It was fine. From your mouth crawled platitudes of understanding."

s "All that matters to me is that you're happy."

s "It doesn't matter what we're doing. If I'm with you, it's a great time."

o "Liar."

o "Idiot."

o "You knew the moment those worms wriggled past your teeth that they had no backbone."

o "As did she. She knew, and you knew, and you each knew you knew, and neither spoke a syllable of it."

o "Fantasies, dreams, pleasant, pleasant lies."

o "She used your gentle lies, of course, to fatten her sack of selfish excuses."

k "What do you mean, you don't want to watch Babes and Babies? I thought you said it didn't matter what we're doing as long as we're together."

k "Was that a lie?"

o "You should have told her yes, yes it was. You should have opened the lanes of communication. What a bold dose of honesty it would have been."

o "To tell her, then and there, of your utter disdain for that abysmal television show."

o "To tell her you said what you thought she wanted to hear. To tell her you knew quite damn well it was a lie and for her to ask such an inane question betrayed your trust."

o "Of course I lied, you should have said, and you knew it, you knew the nature of it. You carried an unlit torch and pretended it lit your way."

o "Instead you sewed the severed limbs meekly back to the body of your bullshit."

s "No, it's not a lie. I love being around you. I just, it's just not something I'm into. It's just, uh, not aimed at me I guess."

o "And in the end you skulked back to your little room with your little computer and your little video games."

o "She returned to her mindless shows. Whether she gave you a second thought, you had no idea. You assumed not. Half of the time, you were right."

o "And you both set marks in your ledgers of hurts. She knew very well she'd inflicted a wound upon you, but chose not to treat it."

o "It was small. It wasn't worth an uncomfortable conversation, let alone a fight."

o "Oh, but if she had shown you some semblance of honesty. She should have told you the truth, you know."

o "I know you hate these shows, she should have said, but I like them and I want to watch them more than I want to put energy and attention into you just now."

o "I know refusing you attention hurts, but I'm more concerned with what I want for myself, just now, than any pain this causes you."

o "Neither of you had the mettle for such honesty."

o "Neither of you deserved the truth."

o "They stacked, you know. The hurts."

o "A pile of anything eventually rises to a single point, given time and quantity. Did you know that?"

o "The angle of repose, it's called. Sugar. Salt. Walls. Leaves. Bullshit. All come to a point."
