    t "So, something goes awry every single season on this show, doesn't it?"

    t "That's part of the fun, right?"

    t "So, we've changed up our schedule a little bit this time as Lichelle has some personal stuff to take care of."

    t "But don't worry! We're going to keep up with her and she may just return on another season!"

    ki "I'm impressed with Tania's ability to sell a vague cover story."

    t "So, we'e decided to move things up a little."

    t "Everyone please welcome back Cassandra and Robin!"

    r "Nothing troubles me, dearest."

    c "..."

    t "Oh, right! Cassandra, would you mind showing off the new toy I gave you?"

    ki "A small smile on Cassandra's face heralds the appearance of her cell phone. She makes a dramatic, overemphasized motion to tap the screen."

    c "< It was no trouble Tania. Thank you for reaching out. Hello, Robin. You look lovely this evening. >"

    ki "Her words flow, not from the phone, but from a pair of wireless speakers set on either side of the stage."

    ki "I wonder why we didn't do this sooner?"

    r "Oh, thank you Cassandra. Yes, I do."

    t "Great, it works! So, shall we talk about what's happened so far?"

    c "< Kylie won't be joining us? >"

    t "She'll be in the wings for now."

    ki "Cassandra's disappointed face reads plainly. I guess she's used to expressing herself visually."

    r "Oh, dear. Does our little butterfly have you wound around her fingers already, then?"

    c "< Maybe. Maybe not. >"

    r "I never expected you to be so easy to attain."

    ki "If I were watching this at home, I would be chucking popcorn at the screen and shouting about Robin being rude."

    ki "Having met her and spoken with her, I feel like these words are calculated rather than bitchy."

    c "< Are you feeling disadvantaged, Robin? Maybe you should shut the lights off and vanish again.>"

    s "Whoa! Stalker much?"

    ki "Robin's placid features flicker for a heartbeat. It's hard to tell, but I thought I saw..."

    ki "Rage?"

    r "You were spying on us, then? I had no idea you had a voyeuristic streak, darling."

    ki "And right back to pristine deconstruction."


    t "Cassandra, is that true? And how did you know where we were going?"

    c "< I knew because Robin is boring. I've been at Ganymead when she was practicing her act. Of course I wasn't spying. >"

    c "< I'm just not an idiot. >"

    s "Cass is fired up."

    r "I would never call you an idiot, dear."
    
    r "An alcoholic, perhaps, a pitiful pity party with a choker that screams for the attention it supposedly protects against."

    ki "The temperature in the room is plummeting."

    c "Cassandra is typing, her features flushed."

    r "Quickly, darling. Wouldn't want half of a witty retort to go to waste."

    t "Robin, let's, uh, let Cassandra have her turn."

    r "If you insist on being bored, be my guest, darling. I'm here for neither of you."

    ki "Tania looks legitimately hurt by that."

    t "Robin, what's gotten into you?"

    r "I have been searching for Kylie for half a decade!"

    ki "her shout snaps Cassandra out of typing for a second."

    t "Wait. Kylie specifically?"

    ki "Robin, for once, doesn't answer."

    c "< I'm not an alcoholic and you're a trash actress. And a cheapskate. I make ten times the money playing anywhere else in this city! >"

    c "< And unlike you I'm not proud of my scars because I didn't give them to myself! >"

    ki "I've had enough. Robin's demeanor breaks, then, and it's not the fury I expected to see."

    k "First off, I like you both so stop hurting each other like this!"

    k "Second, Cassandra, you look hot. Robin, you look amazing. Tania, you already know you look good."

    s "What an odd thing to say."

    ki "A little smile forms on Tania's lips. I don't know if that helped ease the tension, though."

    k "I don't know how much of this is for the show, but I'd rather go home alone than see two people who mean so much to me tear each other apart."

    k "Cassandra, I have loved your music for as long as I can remember. I didn't tell you this the other day, but I have like seven posters of you and a signed guitar I have no idea how to play!"

    k "You showed me your secret and let me hear your real voice. Not this machine, not a text. Your voice cut me into little pieces!"

    k "You... you are everything I imagined you to be and so much more, you're so warm and comfortable and your eyes destroy me."

    k "But you don't need to justify yourself or your scars to anyone! You don't have to be a badass all the time!"


    k "Robin, I... I wish I knew what our first encounter meant to you. I wish I knew, because I might've treated you differently!"

    k "And you..."

    k "You kissed me. In the dark. Just like that, like it was the easiest thing in the world for you. But I felt it!"

    k "I felt those years in that kiss! I could feel you shaking!"

    k "You don't have to pretend to be so refined and in control!"

    k "And you know what else? I have no idea where Lichelle is, but I was looking forward to learning about her, too!"

    s "This is quite a diatribe."
