    l "I coulda killed her."

    l "I coulda killed Sophie and I would've been wrong."

    t "Once you get ahold of someone there's not a lot they can do, is there?"

    l "I wasn't thinking."

    l "I saw her with her hands in the water and someone splashing. I saw that. It was dark."

    t "Why didn't you stop?"

    l "Right? Sophie's five foot nothing. I coulda pulled Louisa out so easy, but..."

    l "I just saw red, babe. I guess I saw Cassie girl running, too, and maybe Sophie had a weapon, I dunno."

    l "It's easy to justify what I did after it's over."

    l "Doesn't make it right."

    t "... Lichelle."

    t "You know Louisa was already dead, right?"

    l "..."

    t "Even if you pulled her out. The amount of heroin in her system was-"

    l "It doesn't matter."

    l "I just... I keep thinking about her shoes. Just layin in the snow. Disappearing."

    pause 0.5

    l "That's just... that's a person. And now she's just a... just a fucking pair of pumps."

    l "... she must've been freezing her ass off even before she..."

    l "..." 

    t "Hey. Take your time."

    l "... If she hadn't been dosed out, I coulda saved her. And I didn't know she was OD'd."

    t "You can't blame yourself for this. Three people were in a position to change how that night went."

    l "Oh yeah? Who? Me. Not Cassie, she did everything she could and then some."

    t "No. Not her."

    l "Then who?"

    t "Sophie and Louisa, primarily. They made the choice to use, Elle. Not you."

    t "And you, well, regardless of what you knew at the time you couldn't have saved Louisa's life."

    l "Then who, Elsa? Who else could there be?"

    t "... me."

    l "The hell. You weren't even in town."

    t "It's my program. Both of them were under my protection and I failed to keep them safe."

    t "So."

    l "You can't blame yourself for their..."

    t "..."

    l "... right. I gotcha."

    t "Yeah."

    t "Hiring you, being your friend, those are some of the best decisions I've ever made."

    t "Tell us about how you helped Cassandra and Sophie, then."

    l "... I can't say I care for this part of the show, babe."

    t "\"Suffering is just weakness leaving the body.\" Right?"

    l "... right."

    t "So? We know what happened on the 13th."

    t "Tell us what happened a month later."

    l "... so Cassie came back to work right away."

    l "It wasn't her, though. It was a puppet."

    t "What does that mean?"

    l "She never said a word. She'd go up to the piano and play like it was the easiest thing in the world."

    l "God, she was good. She didn't smile. She didn't talk. It was kinda like she was wearing a Cassie mask."

    t "I told her she should take time off. She just stared at me."

    l "That girl had problems before any of this. I dunno what her life was like two years ago, but she's got demons. "

    l "Musicians can be like that."

    t "There but for the grace of God go I."

    l "I guess."

    l "Sophie started coming back after about a week I guess."

    l "Just lookin through the window at the fountain."

    l "I'm not proud of it, but I gave her a damn evil eye when I saw her."

    l "She looked like hell."

    t "Was she afraid of you?"

    l "Nope."

    t "Even though you choked her out."

    l "Yeah. She looked like she was about to cry when she saw me."

    l "You know what's fucked up?"

    t "Hm."

    l "Her ex? David? That's my guy. I used to talk shit with that boy all the time."

    l "I never talked to Sophie. When she came in with him, it was like the rest of the world didn't exist."

    l "Same when she was with Louisa."

    t "Sophie showed serious codependency issues. She never saw herself as whole without someone nearby to validate her."

    l "I can see that."

    l "Ain't no way to live."

    t "I agree."

    l "..."

    t "..."

    t "... you're stalling."

    l "Yup."

    t "Elle."

    l "Fine, fine. I saw Cassie leaving with Sophie about two weeks later."

    l "Never saw two more pitiful-looking people together. I didn't ask what was going on."

    l "I should've. I should've learned my lesson with Louisa, but I didn't say anything."

    t "..."

    l "Everything happened fast. Next day they came back together. Cassie played her set, Sophie sat and watched. Kept scratching her face."

    t "She was already using again."

    l "I wish I knew where the hell she kept getting it."

    l "So they left together. Cassie played five nights a week, Sophie was there five nights a week."

    l "That last day they both came in, lemme tell you Elsa, both of them were on the damn nod."

    l "Sophie looked like she hadn't washed her face in a week."

    l "Cassie got up to the piano and started playing fine, but she kept messing up."

    l "First time I ever saw that."

    t "She was falling asleep?"

    l "Her head would kinda drop, then she'd hit a bad note and she'd snap back up."

    l "So I knew they were both dosed up, bad, but what was I gonna do?"

    l "Beat their asses? I already choked Sophie unconscious."

    t "... sure."

    l "That's when I called you."

    l "So halfway through the set Cassie got up and nodded to Sophie. Then they went to the bathroom together."

    l "So... I asked someone to watch the door."

    l "Maybe they were going in there to get some.I was pretty sure Cassie wasn't into women but I didn't know her all that well."

    l "She used to stare at Louisa, though."

    t "I don't think her interest was sexual."

    l "Yeah, nah."

    l "So I waited about ten minutes for them to come out. When they didn't, I tried the door. It was locked, right?"

    l "No sound. I banged on the door. Nothing."

    l "That's about the time you showed up."

    t "Right."

    l "And we got the door open, and there they were."

    l "... funny thing, though."

    t "Hm?"

    l "I know I must've been there, or called the ambulance, or something."

    l "I don't remember anything about what I saw, except Sophie laying on Cassie's lap turning yellow."

    t "You wouldn't, here."

    l "Huh?"

    t "Nevermind."
    
    t "I want you to know they both would've died in there without you paying attention."

    t "I'm pretty sure Cassandra tampered with the doses."

    l "That's why Sophie was turning colors."

    t "Probably."

    l "..."

    t "How do you feel about your role in all this?"
    
    t "You're the only one was wrapped up in all this without being directly connected to it."

    l "Is that how you see it?"

    t "I just think you have a different perspective to offer."

    l "... I think... "

    l "... I think it's weird everybody here knows each other, and three of us are going by some other name."

    l "Why doesn't Cassie get a new name? What about me?"

    t "You would want a different name?"

    l "Not really, but I feel left out."

    t "Hey."

    t "... you're the only one who acted out of anything more than self interest."

    t "Did you think about that?"

    l "... no, I was..."

    t "Just you."

    l "... huh."

    t "One question."

    l "Hm."

    t "You said three of us were going by different names."

    t "Who-"
