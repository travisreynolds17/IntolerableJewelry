    c "It's stupid."

    t "It can't be that bad, hon."

    c "It is. It's emblematic of this whole situation."

    c "A dumb, flashy, look-at-me dress for a useless, flashy, look-at-me girl."

    t "..."

    c "... I picked it because Louisa complimented a customer's outfit."

    t "And the one you wore that night was similar?"

    c "Uh-huh."

    t "So what's the obsession?"

    c "Imagine a theme park."

    t "Not where I expected this to go, but I'm intrigued."

    c "So, you like going. It's fun. It's a rush. It inspires you, just being there."
    
    c "Being around all that energy."

    c "It makes the next day feel fuller."

    c "But you don't want to live there. You can't make that park your everyday reality."

    c "Just reality-adjacent, right?"

    t "So Louisa was like a muse for you?"

    c "I can't tell you how many songs came to me after I met her."

    t "Songs about her?"

    c "No, not generally."

    t "Nothing else in your life could have caused that? Maybe your recovery?"

    c "Shit. No. I was a better musician strung out on dirt than I ever was off it."

    t "Dirt?"

    t "Of course. Sorry, hon."

    c "Anyway. I thought she would notice me. She hadn't so much as looked at me since she met Sophie."

    t "I see."

    c "So... I finished my set. Just a few cool jazz songs for a chilly winter night."

    c "I went... I went to the door, because it was 11 o'clock."

    t "What happens at 11?"

    c "Louisa usually met Sophie at the fountain in front of Ganymead then. They did this... this thing."

    t "Oh?"

    c "Yeah. Louisa would ignore Sophie completely. She'd sit down on the edge of the fountain and kind of... I don't know."

    c "Pose, I guess?"

    t "Pose?"

    c "Yeah. She always put this pillow down first, and she'd just sit and look at the stars or trail her hand in the water."

    c "Sophie would draw her. I watched them more than once."

    c "... that sounds horrible of me."

    t "Hey, no judgment here on One Week Waifu."

    c "Tania."

    t "Right, sorry. Please, go on."

    c "I always thought it was some kind of fetish thing. Like, oh no, I'm just a model without an artist, oh no, what will I do."

    c "Woe is me, I'm just an artist and I can't afford a model. Ha ha, let's make an arrangement. That kind of thing."

    t "You've put a lot of thought into this."

    c "I'm a musician. Artists obsess over things."

    t "Were you jealous of Sophie?"

    c "No. I just didn't want her to take Louisa away."

    t "But you never talked to them about it?"

    c "The hell was I supposed to say?"
    
    c "Hi, you two are obviously deeply in love, but the thing is, I need the tall one never to leave because I use her for inspiration."

    t "Maybe?"
    
    c "I knew Sophie was a problem, too."

    c "Everyone there knew."

    t "Because so many of the staff were related to Elsa's rehab program?"

    c "Yeah. Elsa's."

    t "..."

    c "..."

    c "Sophie was as close to a functioning heroin addict as I've ever seen."

    c "When I came to the door, Lichelle was running toward the fountain."

    c "I remember thinking she moved like a song."

    c "Like her feet never touched the ground."

    t "Do you need a moment?"

    c "No. So I ran out there, too. It was freezing. New England winter, right?"

    t "Right."

    c "I could hear splashing as soon as the door opened."

    c "I saw Sophie bending over the fountain."

    c "I... I saw, I saw Louisa's legs draped over the edge."

    t "What did you think happened?"

    c "At the time? I didn't know. It looked like Sophie was holding her down, but that didn't make sense."

    t "Why not?"

    c "Sophie idolized that woman. She was an addict, but I never heard anything about her being violent."

    c "But... how does someone drown in a fountain?"

    t "It does seem unlikely."

    c "Right. So I thought Sophie was... I don't know. Maybe they had a fight. All I know is I started running, too."

    c "Freezing my butt off in that stupid little black dress."

    c "Lichelle had Sophie in some kind of anaconda hold or something."

    c "Louisa wasn't kicking any more."

    t "What did you do?"

    c "... I pulled her out."

    c "She was so big, Tania. It took everything I had to get her over the rail."

    c "She... she was, she was, she..."

    c "I tried CPR, but I only ever saw other people do it."

    c "I wasn't trained."

    c "There were police there in no time."

    c "... she died right in front of me."

    c "My muse. She drowned in eighteen inches of fountain water, Tania."

    c "Like she was nothing."

    t "That's awful, Cassandra."

    c "Yeah."

    c "It turned out Sophie was trying to pull her out, too."

    c "She was just too strung out to do it."

    t "Sophie was using that night?"

    c "That what Lichelle said. There's security camera footage around the fountain."

    c "They're just... doing their thing, and Louisa kind of sways, and just crumples into the fountain."

    t "... was she using, too?"

    c "Yeah. I guess she just passed out."

    c "That's what it looked like."

    t "Did your opinion of them change when you learned that?"

    c "Who am I to judge that kind of thing? I'm the same kind of person."

    c "... but I took it out on Sophie."

    t "What did you do?"

    c "I screwed her."

    t "Huh?"

    c "I..."

    t "It's okay."

    c "I got close to her. Both of us were just in so much pain, it made it easy."

    c "She was always kind of a... I guess I shouldn't say whore, but anyone with access to dirt could get close."

    t "But you're straight."

    c "Yeah."

    t "You slept with her?"

    c "... yeah."

    t "How can you reconcile those things?"

    c "It's amazing what you can convince yourself is true in a position like that."

    c "I hated her. I was sure she gave the drugs to Louisa. I was sure, so sure, my muse would still be alive if she never met Sophie."

    t "So you had sex with her because you hated her?"

    c "... I wanted to know what Louisa saw in her."

    t "Whoa."

    c "Yeah."

    t "Did you find out?"

    c "I don't know. No? She was ruined anyway. Lost her man, then lost Louisa, back to back."

    c "She wanted to die."

    t "So you..."

    pause 0.2

    c "... yeah. I wanted to help. So... I gave her a bad dose."

    t "Did it... oh my god."

    c "... yeah."

    t "You killed her? How is that possible?"

    c "She didn't die."

    c "As far as I know."

    t "Whoa."

    c "Yeah."

    c "... she forgave me."

    t "What?"

    c "Can you believe it? The stupid junkie bitch told me she forgave me."

    t "She knew about the dose?"

    c "Who knows? She was hallucinating. She probably thought I was someone else."

    c "... but it hit me hard, Tania."

    c "The only person she ever needed to forgive was herself."

    t "Do you think she ever will?"

    c "She has to figure a lot of things out, first. If she still can."

    t "Like what?"

    c "Sophie has to decide what's real for her."

    t "But you can talk now?"

    c "... something about this place. It... adjusts me to be the way it wants me to be."

    t "Yes, it does."
