    "Medical supplies and equipment dominate the room spreading before me. The consistent beep of an EKG, the hiss of a breathing machine."

    "And there, on a pristine bed, a pallid young woman of no more than 20 years lies peaceful and still."

    "There must be a hundred lines connected to her body, attended by a half dozen smaller Mortimers with various arms and attachments."

    s "Oh my..."

    "The security door slides closed behind me. Mortimer floats past my shoulder, settles above the young woman's head."

    "His cute face vanishes, replaced abruptly by a familiar one. A woman with a slightly crooked smile, eyes the blue of a cloudless winter sky."

    "She looks like the girl on the bed, but... healthy."

    s "T... no. Tania?"

    t "Hey. It's good to see you again, Kylie."

    t "Sorry. I meant Sophie."

    "My stomach knots."

    t "I guess you weren't expecting this, huh."

    "I shake my head. Words no longer reside in my mouth."

    t "If it means anything, you're the only person outside my dad's employ who's seen me in years."

    t "How's my body looking? Probably not as cute as you remember."

    s "... you have no, no legs. No arms."

    s "... what happened to you...?"

    t "It's a complicated world, isn't it? To have all the money in the world, all the prestige, and yet."

    s "What do you mean?"

    t "I was in a crash. A drunk driver clipped my dad's car and... well. Here I am."

    s "Are you... are you awake?"

    t "Technically. I have what's called locked-in syndrome. Part of my brain is disconnected, I guess."

    t "Wanna see something spooky?"

    "Mortimer moves, and I can see Tania's body's face again."

    "Her eyes are open and she's looking right at me. Blinking. Gazing."

    s "W-what does that mean?"

    t "I'm almost fully paralyzed. I can move my eyes though, and I can see you. And hear you."

    t "Honestly, I'd expected you to ask how I'm talking through Mortimer by now."

    s "I... s-sorry, I, uh, how?"

    "How poetic. How empathetic, Sophie."

    t "I guess it would freak me out, too. I didn't know how to warn you about me."

    t "My family's stupid rich. Dad runs this future-medical program for the military, working on stuff you'd see in a sci-fi shooter game or something."

    t "Nobody knows about me. I'm a black book project."

    s "Tania, what are you?"

    t "I'm the next step in human evolution. It might not look that way, but it's true."

    t "I'm everywhere. I'm all these machines, Sophie."

    t "My brain is just a processor, now. Isn't that wonderful?"

    s "I... don't know. I don't know, Tania."

    s "It's unbelievable!"

    t "You lived inside a simulation for quite a while, yourself. I wonder what is so unbelievable about it."

    t "Thanks for cracking that open, by the way. I thought [entityName] was going to keep us there forever."

    s "... I need to sit."


    "No sooner than I've said it, a hip-high metal box on wheels skids into sight and unfolds in a dozen directions."
    
    "It's like watching a rose bloom into a chair."
