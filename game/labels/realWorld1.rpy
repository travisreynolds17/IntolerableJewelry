    "I come here, sometimes, when things get heavy."

    "This place has a great bartender. I can never remember his name, though."

    "I get lost in her eyes. Warm, friendly hazel eyes."

    "Sometimes people I know ask why I come back here. If it's worth reopening the wounds of that day just for a prime negroni."

    "But I come back entirely because of that. I loved this place before David, and I'll love this place after."

    "There's a fountain out front, part of the town square. I sit on the bench outside sometimes, with my pad and paper, and just doodle."

    "That's what I'm doing while I sip cranberry juice."

    "There's a woman."

    "I see her sometimes. She likes to sit on the rim of the fountain at night, looking up and down the street."

    "I think she's one of the bar's managers. She always puts a pad down before she sits."

    "Doesn't want to ruin her jeans."

    "She looks around for a while and sighs, like something she wanted to appear stayed home."

    "Her eyes gleam, haunting, spectral baby blues."

    "Then she raises her arms and undoes the clip holding her hair in place, a shower of rich dark chocolate strands."

    "She crosses one endless leg over the other and leans back after that, gazing at the stars."

    "Streetlight pours milkily over her neckline."

    "In my mind I've asked her name a dozen times."

    "In reality I've drawn her twice as often, from every bench in the plaza."

    "Sometimes she undoes the top button of her blouse."

    "Sometimes another. Never more."

    "She never looks directly at me."

    "I wish I knew her name."

    "It's time to go. Fizz and the others need me."
