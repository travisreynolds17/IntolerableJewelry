    r "Dear David was fond of you as well, Tania."

    t "Yeah. He was."

    r "Did you regret your trysts with him?"

    t "I suppose so. At the time I did."

    r "You shouldn't. That darling man needed someone, and you needed to..."

    t "What?"

    r "Forgive me. I am thinking of an American turn of phrase."

    r "Be laid?"

    t "..."

    t "... close enough."

    r "Have sex."

    t "I gotcha, hon."

    r "You are so easily flustered."

    t "Somehow."

    t "Tell me about 11 o'clock on the 13th."

    r "What would you like to know?"

    t "So far this season, we've had access to several different accounts as to what happened at the fountain."

    r "The one in front of Ganymead."

    t "But not the playhouse."

    r "I understand. Lovely Elsa's co-operative."

    r "Well. Your co-operative."

    t "... I'm too transparent."

    r "You are doing well and I commend you."

    t "You're such a snark sometimes."

    r "You noticed?"

    t "Once or twice."

    r "I treasure our friendship, draga mea."

    t "... me, too."

    t "... why did you leave me?"

    r "..."

    t "Why did you have to go and die like that?"

    t "You should have came to me."

    r "I should have."

    t "I could've talked to Sophie. We... we could've figured something out."

    r "I belong to her. If what she wanted from me was to feel the things she felt, I-"

    t "That's bullshit Louisa!"

    t "The things you went through to get here..."

    rr "..."

    t "You aren't some demure little submissive toy."

    rr "... I am not."

    rr "I traveled the world to find her again."

    rr "What if I had refused? With my own eyes I saw her cast David aside for asking her to put her jewelry aside."

    t "Can I tell you something?"

    rr "I am yours."

    t "I always hated Sophie calling heroin \"jewelry\"."

    rr "It seems silly, doesn't it?"

    t "I hated even more that you let her talk you into using. Even after you faked your way into my program."

    rr "..."

    t "... I'm sorry."

    t "I'm not here to attack you."

    rr "I wouldn't defend if you did."

    rr "I should not have abandoned you."

    rr "Not you, not dear Lichelle."

    rr "The person I have become in this place..."

    rr "She is me, but not me. She is more... honest."

    t "Explain the lights out vanishing act to me."

    rr "Another time."

    t "Okay. Explain what happened that night."

    rr "..."

    pause 0.5

    rr "Sophie never called me beautiful, or pretty, or sexy. Others did. Men, of course."

    rr "The words she used were different."

    rr "\"The stars look wrong when you're not there.\""

    rr "She always wanted to sketch me."

    rr "\"My vision blurs without you in it.\""

    rr "Strange things. Artist things, but... artist stalker things."

    t "... I was gonna say."

    rr "Sophie spoke in her own way. It was important to adjust one's perception."

    rr "To understand what she intended to say rather than to rely on what I thought she meant."

    t "That's pretty good advice in general."

    t "She also sounded pretty deeply codependent."

    rr "I'm not sure I understand."

    t "It's like she didn't know how to be her own person. She had to rely on others for her validation."

    rr "This makes her different from most Americans?"

    t "I... well. I guess it's a matter of degree."

    rr "I am unlike that, but my Sophie is the exception."

    rr "I require her."

    rr "And so, when she asked me to partake in her vice, god herself could not have prevented me from doing so."

    rr "That night, I sat as I always did. I learned early that the stone rim of that deplorable fountain would freeze me to the core."

    rr "So learned to place a cushion there."

    t "Everyone talks about that."

    rr "What?"

    t "That you put something down to sit on."

    rr "Is that so strange?"

    t "It's reasonable, I guess."

    rr "I am human, as little as others may wish to believe it. I have no need to pose in the cold only to end up with numb and frozen nethers."

    t "Fair enough."

    rr "My arm burned, Tania. I did not care for the feeling of evil flowing into my veins, but... for her, anything."

    rr "I posed. The world blurred around me but I felt warm, still. Cushioned. Wrapped in something."

    rr "I suppose Sophie filled me too deeply."

    t "You passed out."

    rr "I was aware of the water around me. Freezing, freezing, freezing."

    t "Do you need a moment?"

    rr "I no longer live. What use do I have for more moments?"

    t "Sorry."

    rr "When I hit the water my body shocked to life, and I breathed ice into my lungs. Just like that."

    rr "The pain of this is... it is difficult to describe."

    rr "But my limbs would not respond."

    rr "There were lights, above. The broken shimmers of street lamps."

    t "You had that much awareness when this was going on?"

    rr "In this place, I did."

    t "That's going to confuse our audience."

    rr "Imagine the chaos flickering in my skull."

    rr "Somehow, I know I had kicked my shoes onto the ground."

    t "Yeah, that seems to be a theme here."

    rr "And then..."

    rr "Sophie's wonderful face appeared above me. I felt her hands on my skin, even numb."

    rr "I remember thinking, \"Is this what the man who stole my virginity felt? When I lashed him to his truck and sent it into the Timiș?\""

    pause 0.5

    t "... what?"

    rr "Oh. I apologize. The Timiș is a river that runs through Romania and Serbia."

    rr "I forget Americans isolate their knowledge of geography."

    t "No I mean, you did that to a person?"

    rr "Deservedly so. It is why I left Romania to begin with."

    t "... neat."

    rr "I was happy, dear Elsa. I saw my Sophie's face, even as death embraced me."

    rr "But then, it was gone. Someone else had me."

    

    t "That was Cassandra."

    rr "Oh? Dearest Cassandra. Such a talent, such a lovely human being."

    t "She was obsessed with you, did you know?"

    rr "Yes."

    t "Did you ever talk to her?"

    rr "I could not bear it."

    rr "I am a coward, Elsa. An opportunist."

    t "Nobody would dare call you those things."

    rr "Because they fear me, or they wish to bed me. Truth does not exist in those extremes, my love."

    t "Lichelle was fond of you, too."

    rr "Ah. How I adored beautiful Elle! Such a charming woman."
