To-Do List.

SCRIPT first draft

    1. Write endings. We have several. They are:
        - Tania sex ending -                            Done
        = Lichelle sex ending -                         Done
        - Bad end: Nobody freed, Entity wins
        - Bad end: Only Kylie freed
        - Common end: Entity severed
            - Cass Freed
            - Robin Freed
            - Lichelle Freed
            - Tania Freed
            - Only Entity severed. Bad end.
            Please note there's no sex in this game, only implied. Freed endings give the player a chance to undo something horrible that happened to each character. Robin's party thing, Cass's suicide attempt, (something lichelle).
            - Super secret end lets you undo Tania's murder. Turns out Kylie did it herself between scene transitions.

    2. Comb through script, insert severInput checks in appropriate places. There will be nine attempts.                Done

    3. Insert hints regarding stringSever() function. 

    4. Insert any hidden messages or easter eggs.

    5. We want a complete story in the first draft.

    6. Add a narrator. Someone besides Kylie's inner monologue. Mystery is who it might be.

SCRIPT second draft

    1. Clean up. Identify areas where more dialogue is needed. Note that Doki Doki probably has five times the dialogue you have so far.

    2. Add scenes as necessary. To this point, do not alter the story in major ways.

    3. Create flowchart mapping how labels connect to one another.

    4. Finalize story and copy edit.

    5. Once 4 is completed, determine show/hide/transform style for characters. Implement compelx transorms rather than just show and hide. It needs to feel organic.


ATMOSPHERE

    1. Compose / acquire appropriate music tracks. We will need:
        - Intro / splash music
        - Common "Everything's going fine" music. Consider the          reggae loop from DDLC.
        - Character music. A normal and a dark common version for each.
        - sad music.
        - dread music.
        - things are looking up music
        - add to this list as stuff comes to you.

    2. Acquire sound effects. This will be a pain in the ass. Go royalty free or even look into purchasing a CHEAP sound library.

    3. Keep a runnin list of what each soundfile is called and who to credit if applicable. SAME goes for if we grab some royalty free music tracks to lighten the load.

    4. Choose color scheme, adjust GUI.

ART

    1. Character art. No choice but to do this yourself, somehow. Base models, facial expressions, a few poses.
    2. CG screens: Big splash screens for major events and/or endings.
    3. Intro screen art.
    4. Backgrounds. You might get away with tracing or photomanipulating the pexels backgrounds, at least at first. Your writing is really the important part, right?
    5. Any displayables that will layer onto the game. I.E. if each character has a special item or something. 

Post-op

    1. Design the credits. 


Thoughts:
    I wish I had help. A partner in this would be awesome, but I can't trust anybody outside my limited friend circle, and my limited circle are busy and/or have no game-design chops.

##CURRENT TODO CURRENT TODO##

Figure out how common end works. There's nothing climactic about this. We need to have some kind of character choice, some stake. Something that delivers the end. 

The entity's too nebulous. It needs to be physical, somehow.
