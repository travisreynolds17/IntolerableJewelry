New todo as of 8-9

- Robin's sprite needs work. Some expressions are off. Pose 1 is off balance.
- Tania's 2 pose has some shading issues. looks like she pissed herself.
- Title screen and end credits
- Main gui still has green lines. Adjust gui sprite so it has dark instead of green anyway
- Fix lichelle's lip gloss. far away it looks like she has a mike tyson tooth.
- Fix choices so they center in the game gui unless outside the game.
- fix bg playhouse beginning robindate2
- maybe another fontaine pose?
- fix image of cass lich tania showing up when fontaine does. splice them together? or like a whirling circle of their heads sewn to a thing?
- fix fontaine zoom when she tells Sophie about stopping her heart
- sprinkle a few more affection raisers. Maybe comment on how they aren't big moments every time.
- fix and fill out trivia
- fix ask fontaine sprite
- fix chat history screen. note recaps and chat history are reversed. art and buttons.

- art of kylie and fontaine bleeding out 

- more scenes with lichelle. add one with her and Robin, and one with her and Tania. Just girl stuff.
- "true" ending for kylie involves reaching a point, on a second playthrough at least, where Kylie is the most self aware. Breaking free means Kylie and Louisa-Robin get together inside the delusion. 
- maybe points system for seing all trivia? You can sever them after you learn them.
